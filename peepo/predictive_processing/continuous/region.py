        The Predictive Processing algorithm used here is based on
        M.W. Spratling (2016): Predictive Coding as a Model of Cognition
        For a non-technical intro, see A. Clark (2013):
        Whatever next? Predictive brains, situated agents,
        and the future of cognitive science

        A region is a small part in the whole hiearchy of the neocortex.
        It takes as input a vector of some values, which can come from
        low level input (raw) mechanisms, such as values given by the retina,
        or they can come from another region from a lower or the same level.
        The output is a vector (usually smaller in size, to decrease
        complexity at a higher level, and to allow some form of generalization)

        A region iterates to reach a prediction model with (in theory)
        zero prediction errors. This is achieved through 3 formulas:

            r = Vy
            e = x (/) max(r, p2)
            y = max(y, p1) (*) We

        Where r are the (m by 1) reconstruction neurons, e the (m by 1)
        error neurons, y the (n by 1)prediction neurons, x the (m by 1)
        input values, p1 and p2 some paramater values to avoid division
        by zero errors and a stagnant model, W is a (m by n) matrix,
        representing the synaptic weights, and V the transpose of V
